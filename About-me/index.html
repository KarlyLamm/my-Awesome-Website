<h2 class='sub-title'>My Background</h2>
  <p>Welcome! My name is Karly Lamm, currently living in the greater Saint Louis area. I believe that education
    and culture are invaluable and precious so I strive to continually broaden my knowledge, stay out of my comfort
    zone, and remain open-minded to new challenges. I love to embrace my passions, and take chances on 
    opportunities I find. Some hobbies that I like to fill my days with include traveling, hiking, snow skiing, 
    photography, learning new programming skills, puzzles, and working with specialty coffee. Some of my favorite destinations I 
    have traveled to would be:</p>

<h2 class='sub-title'>Personal Journey to Software development<h2>
    <p>
       My goal is to become a software engineer. While I could say that I found programming, the truth is 
       that programming found a way to me. In a transitional period for me, programming came in at just the right time.
       While I believe I was meant to work in the tech field, I have not always seen my carear field in it. I attended a 
       Pharmacy school for several years in pursuit of a PharmD; however,
       I have always been drawn to the worlds of math, science, and computers. Growing up in a rapidly developing tech world, 
      I have always been fascinated with the idea of creation and electronics. From my toddler ages of 
      attempting to build non-functional robots from soup cans with the imagination that they were programmed, 
      to middle-school days of downloading programs on the home computer to make stick-figure animation games. When 
    I first typed the words "Hello, World" into the console of my application, I knew I was hooked.</p>
